# CV funk — Modules for VCV Rack

CV funk is a growing collection of VCV Rack modules focused on **expressive modulation, sequencing, and patch-programmable control systems**.  

The collection spans envelope generators, sequencers, clocking tools, macro controllers, oscillators, effects, and experimental CV processors. Many of the modules are intentionally open-ended: they reward patching, feedback, and cross-modulation rather than fixed signal paths.

With over 40 modules and ongoing development, CV funk emphasizes:
- Macro-driven modulation
- Nonlinear sequencing concepts
- Compact, information-dense interfaces
- Patch-first experimentation

Whether you are building generative systems, structured sequences, or evolving control networks, CV funk is designed to bring a new twist to your VCV patches.
