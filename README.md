# CV funk Module Collection for VCV Rack

Explore the vast possibilities of modular synthesis with the CV funk Module Collection, designed for VCV Rack. This suite of modules simplifies generating a complex spectrum of modulation and sound from simple inputs. The modules are each carefully engineered to inject dynamic modulation, intricate sequencing, and immersive soundscapes into your musical creations! From the precise steps of the Penta Sequencer to the wide range of creative freedom offered by the Step Wave, each module is designed to explore patch-programmable modular synthesis in a new way, inviting you to dive deep into the complexities of sound design with intuitive macro-controls.

## Modules Overview

### Steps
A fusion of comparison logic and step sequencing makes complexity from simple controls. It visually displays the current position within the window.

### Envelope Array
An envelope generation powerhouse, offering smooth controls over the shape and dynamics of your sound. With six related envelope stages featuring adjustable slant and curve parameters. Creates single-shot or cycling envelopes ranging from ms to minutes.

### Penta Sequencer
A 5-step sequencer that redefines rhythmic and melodic structuring, offering Circle and Star modes for unique sequencing. Directional control and adjustable slew for smooth transitions.

### Impulse Controller
Simulate the movement of waves through a network of nodes with the Impulse Controller module. This module offers a unique approach to modulation, with 24 outputs representing the ebb and flow of energy through a complex node connected network.

### Signals
Observe and compare six signal inputs. Range from ms to secs with selector switch. With trigger reset toggle for visualizing envelopes.

### Ranges
Split two signals into a range of 0-12 fractional mixes. Easily generate musical intervals, pan or attenuate voltages, or as a source.

### Hex Mod
Six phase related LFOs, with Sync and unique controls over the phasing.

### Collatz
Generate polyrhythmic trigger sequences synchronized to a clock. Uses the Collatz conjecture to generate interesting patterns of polyrhythms.

### Strings
Generates chord voicings of a guitar. Intuitive button interface makes generating chord progressions a breeze. Displays guitar chords. Allows per string bending, whammy bar bending, and capo.

### Magnets
Explore magnetism by interacting with a small spin-lattice simulation. Interact with the lattice with CV inputs. Outputs 24 4-pole filtered LFO signals.

### Ouros
A stereo phase injection oscillator with a unique polar display. Generate unique timbres, animated waveforms, and stereo effects. Morph continuously in an enormous latent space of complex wave shapes.

### Pressed Duck
A stereo 6 channel side-chain ducking mixer with compression, saturation, and feedback distortion.

### Flower Patch
A 12-tone scale polar visualizer for audio signals using FFT processing.

### Syncro
An 8-channel clock ratio generator.

### Nona
A 9-channel CV gain/offset utility mixer.

### Decima
A 10-channel gate sequencer with per-step probability.

### Morta
A single-knob macro-controller utility with 16 simultaneous outputs in different ranges.

### Step Wave
An 8-step wave sequencer with rhythmic displacement control over the boundaries between stages, and variable shape control for each stage.

### Preeeeeeeeeeessed Duck
A sixteen channel version of Pressed Duck

### Arrange
A 7-channel input sampling sequencer/programmer.

### Tri Delay
A 3-tap delay effect with 8x oversampled anti-aliasing, anti-derivative anti-aliased tanh saturation, and lagrange fractional delays.

### Tatami
A stereo polyphonic wavefolder effect with anti-aliasing.

### Cartesia
A 4x4x4 CV and gate sequencer with CV control over the knob range, live-updating displays, and anti-aliasing.

### Junk DNA
A DNA-based gate sequencer. Input IUPAC DNA codes to generate randomized DNA repeats, and then sequence them.

### Picus
A seven stage clock multiplier busrt sequencer, features programmable pulse patterns and multiple outputs.

### Node
A compact two channel stereo crossfading mixer with 5x gain, gentle tanh saturation and ADAA.
