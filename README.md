## Modules Overview

### Steps
A fusion of comparison logic and step sequencing, this module allows for dynamic pattern creation, influenced by external voltage levels. It provides hands-on control over bias, range, and step characteristics, complemented by clear visual feedback on the current state and progression.

### Envelope Array
An envelope generation powerhouse, the Envelope Array offers unparalleled control over the shape and dynamics of your sound. With six related envelope stages featuring adjustable slant and curve parameters, it opens up a realm of expressive modulation possibilities. Creates single-shot or cycling envelopes ranging from ms to minutes.

### Penta Sequencer
A 5-step sequencer that redefines rhythmic and melodic structuring, offering Circular and Star modes for diverse sequencing, complete with directional control and adjustable slew for smooth transitions, all visually guided by intuitive step indicators.

### Impulse Controller
Simulate the mesmerizing movement of waves through a network of nodes with the Impulse Controller module. This module not only brings a visual spectacle to your rack but also offers a unique approach to spatial sound design and dynamic modulation, with 24 outputs representing the ebb and flow of energy through the network.

### Signals
Observe and compare six signal inputs. Range from ms to sec. Includes a trigger reset toggle.

### Ranges
Split two signals into a range of 0-12 fractional mixes. Easily generate musical intervals.

### Hex Mod
Six phase related LFOs, with Sync and unique controls over the phasing.
